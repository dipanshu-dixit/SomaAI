# Security and Performance Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Log Injection (CWE-117) - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: User input was being logged without sanitization
- **Fix**: Added `sanitizeForLog()` function that encodes user input and redacts sensitive headers
- **Impact**: Prevents log manipulation and exposure of sensitive data

### 2. Missing Authorization (CWE-862) - HIGH PRIORITY  
- **Issue**: API endpoints lacked proper authorization checks
- **Fix**: Added `requireAuth()` middleware to verify requests come from allowed origins
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to protected endpoints

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: CSRF protection was incomplete and could be bypassed
- **Fix**: Enhanced CSRF protection to require Origin/Referer headers and validate against allowed origins
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious cross-site requests

### 4. Performance Issues - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: Rate limiting used in-memory Map without cleanup, causing memory leaks
- **Fix**: Added periodic cleanup every 5 minutes to remove expired entries
- **Impact**: Prevents memory exhaustion in production

### 5. Insufficient Logging - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: Sensitive data (auth tokens, medical symptoms) exposed in logs
- **Fix**: Added environment checks to only log detailed data in development mode
- **Impact**: Protects user privacy and sensitive information

## Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 6. Lazy Module Loading
- **Issue**: Modules imported inside functions causing performance issues
- **Fix**: Moved all imports to top of files
- **Impact**: Improved application startup performance

### 7. Package Vulnerabilities
- **Issue**: Vulnerable semver package version
- **Fix**: Updated package.json to use scoped naming and added security dependencies
- **Impact**: Reduced security vulnerabilities

### 8. Error Handling Improvements
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling and poor error messages
- **Fix**: Added proper input validation and consistent error handling patterns
- **Impact**: Better user experience and debugging

## React Performance Fixes

### 9. JSX Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Arrow functions in JSX props causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Fix**: Extracted handlers using useCallback and memoized expensive operations
- **Impact**: Improved React component performance

### 10. Error Boundary Implementation
- **Issue**: Direct DOM manipulation in error handling
- **Fix**: Implemented proper React Error Boundary component
- **Impact**: Better error handling following React best practices

## New Security Dependencies Added

- `helmet@^7.1.0` - Security headers middleware
- `express-rate-limit@^7.1.5` - Advanced rate limiting

## Installation Instructions

1. Run `install-security-deps.bat` to install new dependencies
2. Restart your backend server
3. Test the application to ensure everything works

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` files:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Your OpenRouter API key
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend URL (default: http://localhost:5173)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to 'production' in production

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test CSRF protection by making requests from unauthorized origins
2. Test rate limiting by making rapid requests
3. Verify logs don't contain sensitive information in production
4. Test error boundaries by causing intentional errors
5. Monitor memory usage to ensure cleanup is working

## Production Deployment Notes

- Set `NODE_ENV=production` to disable debug logging
- Configure proper CORS origins for your domain
- Consider implementing proper JWT-based authentication
- Set up monitoring for rate limit violations
- Regular security audits recommended
